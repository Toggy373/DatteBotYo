  <h1>ðŸ“„ DatteBotYo Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 7/7/25</p>

  <h2>1. Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
  <p>DatteBotYo is provided as-is. While we aim for reliability and security, we make no guarantees regarding uptime, performance, or data accuracy.</p>

  <h2>2. Google Sheet Integration</h2>
  <p>When you link your character via a Google Sheet, DatteBotYo reads specific cells on your behalf. We do not share, sell, or modify your Google Sheet content beyond what is necessary to fetch your character data.</p>
  <p>You are responsible for ensuring that the sheet you provide follows the supported template.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>DatteBotYo stores your character data (such as names, stats, resources, and imported URLs) in a private MySQL database for functionality across sessions. This data is associated with your Discord user ID, and only you can access or modify your character data.</p>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You may not use DatteBotYo in any way that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Harasses or abuses others</li>
    <li>Violates Discordâ€™s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service</li>
    <li>Attempts to compromise, overload, or misuse the bot or its database</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Violation of these rules may result in data removal or bot access being revoked.</p>

  <h2>5. Service Limitations and Changes</h2>
  <p>DatteBotYo may change or shut down at any time without notice. Features may be added, removed, or updated as development continues.</p>
